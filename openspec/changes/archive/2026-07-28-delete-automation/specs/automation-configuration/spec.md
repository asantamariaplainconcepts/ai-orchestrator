## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: an Automation that no Run has used can be deleted

An Admin SHALL be able to delete an Automation, and the deletion SHALL be refused when any Run —
active or terminal — references it. The refusal SHALL state how many Runs do and SHALL point at
disabling as the alternative, and the Automation SHALL be unchanged. A deleted Automation SHALL
disappear from listings and from matching, and its trigger SHALL become available to a new
Automation. Deletion SHALL be scoped to the project: an Automation belonging to another project
SHALL be reported as not found.

#### Scenario: never used

- **WHEN** an Admin deletes an Automation no Run has ever referenced
- **THEN** it is gone from the listing and from matching

#### Scenario: used, so refused

- **WHEN** an Admin deletes an Automation with Runs
- **THEN** the refusal names how many Runs reference it, suggests disabling, and changes nothing

#### Scenario: an in-flight Run is unharmed

- **WHEN** deletion is refused because a Run is active
- **THEN** that Run still resolves its Automation and completes normally

#### Scenario: the trigger is freed

- **WHEN** a new Automation is created with a deleted one's trigger
- **THEN** it is accepted — the overlap it would have collided with no longer exists

#### Scenario: another project's Automation

- **WHEN** deletion names an Automation belonging to a different project
- **THEN** it is reported as not found
