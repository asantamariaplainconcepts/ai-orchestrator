## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: an Admin edits, disables and re-enables an Automation

An Admin SHALL be able to change an Automation's trigger, action, runtime, approval flag and
timeout, and to disable and re-enable it. An edit SHALL face the same BR-003 overlap validation
as a create, excluding the Automation being edited from the comparison. Enabling SHALL re-run
that validation; disabling SHALL NOT, because a disabled Automation cannot overlap anything.
Editing or disabling SHALL NOT affect Runs already active — they complete against the
Automation they were created with.

#### Scenario: an edit that would overlap is refused

- **WHEN** an edit would make the trigger intersect another enabled Automation's
- **THEN** it is refused with the create-time error and nothing changes

#### Scenario: an unchanged trigger does not overlap itself

- **WHEN** an edit leaves the trigger as it was
- **THEN** it succeeds — the Automation is not compared against itself

#### Scenario: re-enabling re-checks

- **WHEN** a disabled Automation whose trigger now collides with a newer one is enabled
- **THEN** it is refused and stays disabled

#### Scenario: disabling stops future matches only

- **WHEN** an Automation with an active Run is disabled
- **THEN** the Run is unaffected and no new match is made for that trigger
